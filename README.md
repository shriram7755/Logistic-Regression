# Logistic-Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for modeling the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It is a type of regression analysis commonly used for classification problems.

key points about logistic regression:

1)Binary Outcome: Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable (the outcome) is categorical with two possible outcomes, typically coded as 0 or 1.

2)Sigmoid Function: Logistic regression models the probability of the outcome using the logistic function (also called the sigmoid function), which ensures that the predicted probabilities range between 0 and 1

3)Linear Combination: In logistic regression, the log-odds of the outcome (logit) are modeled as a linear combination of the predictor variables.

4)Model Interpretation: The coefficients (beta) obtained from logistic regression represent the change in the log-odds of the outcome associated with a one-unit change in the predictor variable, holding other variables constant.

5)Maximum Likelihood Estimation: Logistic regression estimates the parameters (coefficients) by maximizing the likelihood function. The most common method for this is the maximum likelihood estimation.

6)Assumptions: Logistic regression assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the outcome is linear. It also assumes that there is little or no multicollinearity among the independent variables.
